			As an immigrant from South Africa and a Chinese flagship student at Brigham Young University, I will bring valuable perspectives and experiences to any role around US-China relationships, as well as leverage my obsession & knowledge of Chinese to be valuable for the United States. My mother always told me to "rise above mediocrity", and this counsel has propelled me to interpreting multiple Chinese court cases, translating highly important legal documents for lawyers in Utah, interpreting tapped-in phone calls into English, all of which are self-taught. I willingly spend hours each day learning Mandarin vocabulary, consuming Chinese media, and learning the colloquial frames of speech on my own accord. Why? Because in my life this has been the only thing that truly interests me. It is my calling to learn Chinese.
